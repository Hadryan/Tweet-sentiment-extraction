 Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
# Introduction
In recent years, a huge number of people have been attracted to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. People use social sites to express their emotions, beliefs or opinions about things, places or personalities. It's not only people expressing their views, but social media has evolved to a greater dimension where brands, politicians, journalists, influencers all co-exists together with different agendas like promoting products/ideologies, entertaining people, demanding justice and whatnot. 
As the title suggests in this project we are going to do Tweet Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis is the process of 'computationally' determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.
As of Q1 2019, Twitter has over 336 million monthly active users (MAU) worldwide as compared to 321 million in Q4 2018 and 326 million for Q3 2018. Interestingly, every month, roughly 500 million people access Twitter without logging in.\

Going by some statistics HERE is the reason why we choose twitter over other platforms:\
•	Worldwide, Twitter has over 336 million monthly active users and 100 million daily active users.\
•	23% of the Internet population is said to be on Twitter.\
•	Top 5 countries on Twitter accounts for 50% of overall Tweets.\
•	2 billion Queries are served by Twitter on a daily basis.\
•	83% of the World's Leaders have Twitter accounts.\
•	There are 24.6% verified Journalists on Twitter.\
•	77% brands feel positive upon a Tweet that's been replied to.\
•	58% of the top brands on Twitter have more than 10k followers.\
•	95% of companies post one or more Tweet in a day.\
•	India has over 34.4 million monthly active users on Twitter.

Growth in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis has been rapid and aims to explore the opinions or text present on different platforms of social media through machine-learning techniques with the sentiment, subjectivity analysis or polarity calculations. 
we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of human language, and machine learning to automatically deliver accurate results.

# Scope

In the times where hate across social media platforms has visibly increased and
triggered debates on mental health, we believe such an analysis will allow people to
recognize wheater the tweets on an account are on the negative or positive side.\

Why Is Twitter Sentiment Analysis important?\
Twitter sentiment analysis allows you to listen to your customers and understand what
they need. By introducing sentiment analysis tools into your workflows, you can
automatically organize unstructured information (which includes Twitter data) in real-
time, at scale, and accurately:\
* Scalability: Analyze hundreds or thousands of tweets mentioning your brand
and automate manual tasks.\
* Business: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to
understand customers&#39; feelings towards products or brand, how people respond
to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don&#39;t buy some
products.\
* Real-Time Analysis: Twitter sentiment analysis is essential for monitoring
sudden shifts in customer moods, detecting if complaints are on the rise, and for
taking action before problems escalate.\
* Politics: In the political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect
consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the
government level. It can be used to predict election results as well!\
* Consistent Criteria: Avoid inconsistencies that stem from several agents
tagging data against different criteria. Instead, train a machine learning model to
perform sentiment analysis, using one set of rules, on all your Twitter data, so
results are consistent.\
* Public Actions: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social
phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining
the general mood of the blogosphere.
