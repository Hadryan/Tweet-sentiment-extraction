# Problem statement 
 Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
# Introduction
In recent years, a huge number of people have been attracted to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. People use social sites to express their emotions, beliefs or opinions about things, places or personalities. It's not only people expressing their views, but social media has evolved to a greater dimension where brands, politicians, journalists, influencers all co-exists together with different agendas like promoting products/ideologies, entertaining people, demanding justice and whatnot.

As the title suggests in this project we are going to do Tweet Sentiment Extraction. It is the process of 'computationally' determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 

We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of human language, and machine learning to automatically deliver accurate results.
Before that it’s important to go through some terms:

Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if the stem itself is not a valid word in the Language.

Lemmatization: Lemmatization, unlike Stemming, reduces the inflected words properly ensuring that the root word belongs to the language. In Lemmatization root word is called Lemma. A lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is the canonical form, dictionary form, or citation form of a set of words.

# Scope
In the times where hate across social media platforms has visibly increased and triggered debates on mental health, we believe such an analysis will allow people to recognize whether the tweets on an account are on the negative or positive side. Thus, negative tweets with foul language/message can be hidden from a group of people below certain age or it can help brands to study their audience.
